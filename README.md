ðŸš§ Under Heavy Construction ðŸš§

This project is undergoing a complete rewrite. We're almost there.

For the legacy VS Code extension known as [Data-pack Helper Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-language-server), check out
* [Branch `release/3.3.0`](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass/tree/release/3.3.0) for server-side code;
* [SpyglassMC/vscode-extension](https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vscode-datapack/tree/release/3.3.0) for client-side code;
* [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-language-server) for use.

Spyglass aims at improving users' editing experience of Minecraft data packs by providing IntelliSense features like
real-time error reporting, auto-completion, semantic coloring, code navigation tools, and refactor utilities.

## Documentation

WIP at https://spyglassmc.com.

## Contributing

1. ```shell
	$ git clone https://github.com/SpyglassMC/Spyglass.git
	```
2. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. ```shell
	$ npm i && npm run build
	```

If you're using VS Code to develop Spyglass:

- Install the recommended [ESLint extension][eslint-extension]. Make a copy of `.vscode/settings.template.json` and rename it to `.vscode/settings.json`.
  Now your VS Code should automatically fix all linting errors every time you save the file.
- Press F5 to run the VS Code extension in development environment. VS Code will automatically compile all packages and build the extension file in watch mode.

Or if you prefer the command line interface:

- `npm run build` to build all packages.
- `npm run watch` to watch changes and build all packages.
- `npm run clean` to remove all js output. Use this when there seem to be caching issues with TypeScript's compiler.
- `npm test` to test all packages.
- `npm run lint` to check linting errors.
- `npm run lint:fix` to fix all auto-fixable linting errors.
- `npm run commit` to run the [`gitmoji` CLI][gitmoji]. You actually don't have to worry about commit message as long as you're creating PR, as I can always change it.

Please refrain from using `mocha --watch`, as it might interface with and break the snapshot testing.

### Code style

Tabs for indents, spaces for alignment. Except do not align things because the available tooling is unfortunately terrible.

### Test docs locally

1. Install Jekyll according to [its documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/#instructions).
2. Run `npm run docs:start` to start a local preview at `localhost:4000`.

### Build Pipeline

The `build` script at the root level does the following steps in series:

* Run the `build` script in `./packages/locales`.
* Run the TypeScript compiler across all packages.
* Then, do the two steps in parallel:
	1. Run the `build` script in `./packages/playground`.
	2. Run the `build` script in `./packages/vscode-extension`.
